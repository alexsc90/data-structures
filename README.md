## General info

During the course we went through the main data structures you can find while working with ***JavaScript***. The excercises you'll find in this repo represent my reponse to the exercises proposed during the course. In the root directory you'll find a folder for each of the data structures we studied during the course: 

### Contents 

* array
  * Static.
  * Dinamic (the default behaviour for JS arrays).

* Strings
  * In order to work with these, you'll treat them as arrays.

* Hash Table
  * It pairs keys to values, similar to when working with objects.

* Linked List
  * Singly.
  * Doubly.

* Stack
  * Holds a list of elements, in which the order they were introduced will be the order they'll be retrieved. (FILO, first in, last out).

* Queues
  * FIFO(first in, first out). The first element to be removed will be the first element added.

* Binary Tree
  * Collection of nodes connected in order by some edges.

* Graphs
  * They can be represented as an edge list, adjacent list or as an adjacent Matrix.

## Usage

The code you'll find in the *.js* files, can be run directly from your IDE if you count with the *Code Runner* extension. In this particular case, I've used [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

If you prefer, you can run them directly from your browser within the console. If you want to do so, you'll need to add manually each of the calls to the methods in the functions creaated here...

Have fun! ;)
